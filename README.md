This project is an intelligent Jainism-focused chatbot powered by LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), designed to answer user queries with accurate and context-aware responses. It integrates a PDF document loader to process Jainism-related texts, uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to efficiently segment content, and stores embeddings in a Chroma vector database for fast semantic search. A retriever fetches the most relevant information, while integrated tools like Wikipedia Search enhance responses with real-time and event-specific details. The Streamlit UI provides a clean, interactive interface with a custom page icon and branding. This chatbot can be used for religious education, event awareness, and cultural preservation, with potential future upgrades including voice interaction, multilingual support, and advanced knowledge graph integration.
